## Twitter SMS - Project Charter
 

Twitter SMS is a social networking service that is available to registered users and can be accessed through web interface or mobile-device application software. This application creates a great display experience for readers  

With SMS, users are able to interact with other users through posts known as "tweets". Posts can include images, videos, or short messages that are limited to 280 characters. A social media interface allows users to like and comment on follower's posts. 

### Business Proposition

**User Value**

Create an entertaining platform for users to connect with people and express their thoughts with a big audience. Liking and Commenting are tools available to the users. 


**Learning Value**
