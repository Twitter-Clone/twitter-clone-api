Goal: Test Plan

**Outline of testing that will be used**
 Testing will be done every time we work on the project. We will be using GitHub and Python for testing services. Testing will be done essentially when the group meets. We will be
 incoorperating some of the testing from the test level hierarchy. We will most likely use each level of the hierarchy, bur for now testing will include manual acceptance testing,
 quick development tests, and page tests. We will do more testing in the future when we get further along on our project. 

**Setup structure for testing**
Structure for testing will be working on our local machines, pushing up the changes that we have made, then determining if those changes still need imporvement. This process will
be repeated and we will probably take turns on testing. We might split the team up and have two people work on testing while the other two continue to work on progress of the
overall project.

**Log issues**
 Each time that an issue is encountered, the team will attempt to fix the problem. Each problem that the team comes in contact with, will be documented with a date, and a 
 description of what the issue is. If the team happens to find any useful resources on how to fix an issue, those resources will be documented for future use. 

**Document how to log issues**
 We will create a spreadsheet or a sharred doc that we can all contribute to, then we will go and research how to fix the issues, along with making notes as to when that issue
 came up and when it was completed. If we happen to run into similar issues or problems we will already have them doccumented.
